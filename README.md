* **Debug** - Tools to debug CSS
* **Functions** - Blocks of code that return a single value of any Sass data type
* **Layouts** - Macro layout styles ( container, grid ...)
* **Mixins** - Groups of CSS declarations that you want to reuse throughout your site
* **Utilities** - Single use classes to perform a single function or change a single attribute (.display-none, .clear-fix ...)
* **Vendors** - Third party libraries
* **_settings.scss** - Variables, colors, grid setup, config switches ecc...
* **main.scss** - Import all other files

## Namespaces
* `.js-` - JavaScript hooks: Signify that this piece of the DOM has some behaviour acting upon it, and that JavaScript binds onto it to provide that behaviour.
* `.is-|.has-` - State classes: Signify that the piece of UI in question is currently styled a certain way because of a state or condition.
